This is a repository for LGMVIP Task-1 using HTML, CSS and Javascript

Working Description - 
=> This To-Do list allows us to manage tasks by marking them as completed or incomplete. To add a new task, simply input the task in the designated box and click the "Add" button to append it to the list.
=> For task management, you can click on the task name to toggle its completion status. Additionally, a close icon is provided to enable the deletion of specific tasks from the list.
=> To enhance user experience, this JavaScript project incorporates Local Storage. The task list is stored in your web browser, which means that even if you close and restart the browser, your saved To-Do list will persist and be readily displayed.
